## Part 3: Analysis Protocol

### Step 1: Name Generation
Generate 10-15 candidate names that satisfy ALL technical constraints listed in Part 1.

**Output Format:**
```
[NAME] | [CHARACTER COUNT] | [ETYMOLOGY/MEANING] | [ARABIC TRANSLITERATION]
```

### Step 2: Initial Filtering
Eliminate candidates that fail any of the following:
- USPTO trademark conflicts (active registrations in Class 042/044)
- .com domain unavailable AND premium pricing (>$10,000 acquisition cost)
- Negative connotations in English or Arabic
- Pronunciation difficulty (subjective assessment)

**Output Format:**
```
[NAME] | [PASS/FAIL] | [FAILURE REASON IF APPLICABLE]
```

### Step 3: Comprehensive Scoring
For each remaining candidate, provide detailed scores across all evaluation dimensions (Part 2).

**Output Format:**
```
[NAME]
├─ Linguistic Analysis
│  ├─ Phonetic Clarity: [X/10] - [Brief justification]
│  ├─ Memorability: [X/10] - [Brief justification]
│  └─ Spelling Consistency: [X/10] - [Brief justification]
├─ Semantic Strength
│  ├─ Domain Relevance: [X/10]
│  ├─ Cultural Resonance: [X/10]
│  └─ Innovation Perception: [X/5]
├─ Legal & Commercial Viability

TOTAL SCORE: [X/100]
```

### Step 4: Comparative Ranking
Rank all candidates by total score, providing:
1. Top 3 recommendations with full rationale
